# Design patterns implemented in Java


# Introduction

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

# Getting started

This site showcases Java Design Patterns. The solutions have been developed by
experienced programmers and architects from the open source community. The 
patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions or by looking at their
source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought as
programming tutorials on how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most
popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
